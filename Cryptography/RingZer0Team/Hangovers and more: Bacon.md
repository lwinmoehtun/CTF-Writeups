I saved the msg in bacon.txt

The message was composed with Capital & Small letters. It can be assume as two types of letter. The cipher that uses two types of letter is baconian cipher.
Ahh! of course, bacon is described as hint.
Usual one may be AABBBABBABABAB...

Let's assume Capital letter as 'A' and Small letter as 'B'.Ignore(remove) [spaces ., '!]

Here we go!
