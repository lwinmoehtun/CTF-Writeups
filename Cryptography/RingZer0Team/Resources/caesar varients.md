This shifting property can be hidden in the name of Caesar variants, eg :

CD code, C = D, the shift is 1

Jail (JL) code, J = L, the shift is 2

Ellen (LN) code, L = N, the shift is 2

Cutie (QT) code, Q = T, the shift is 3

Eiffel (FL) code, F = L, the shift is 6

WC code, W = C, the shift is 6

Empty (MT) code, M = T, the shift is 7

Baden Powell (scoutism founder), B = P, the shift is 14

Any (NE) code, N = E, the shift is 17

See You (CU) code, C = U, the shift is 18

I See (IC) code, I = C, the shift is 20

Easy (EZ) code, E = Z, the shift is 21

CEASAR (with a wrong spelling) where E=A or A=E, the shift is either +4 or -4 (=22)

August Cipher = Caesar Chiper with the shift of 1

Index of coincidence of caesar cipher is similar to that of plain text.

IC of plain text is about 0.07
