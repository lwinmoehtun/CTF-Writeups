We got an audio file.

It looks like to find flag in sound waves. I opened this file in sonic vaisualiser.

I found a [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_numerals) text.

Converting to maya numerals: 
>69593078616075

It looks like decimal but it does not. It must be decrypted in hex. Maya's hexadecimal will not exceed 9 because 9 is max in numerals.

Change hex to ascii code: <tt>iY0xa`u</tt>
