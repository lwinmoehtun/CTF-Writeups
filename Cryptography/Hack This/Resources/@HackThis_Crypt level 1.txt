It's obvious that is a reversed string. I solved in python.

>>>msg = 'tpyrcoow :ssap siht retne level siht etelpmoc oT .rewop niarb fo tol a yolpme ot deen lliw uoy ,cigol dna noitpyrced tuoba lla era slevel esehT .sihtkcah no slevel tpyrc eht ot emoclew ,olleH'

>>>''.join(reversed(msg))

(or)
If you are good at in loop,

flag = ''
for i in msg:
    flag = i + flag
print(flag)

(or)
You can also use slice.

>>>msg[::-1]

It's syntax is [start,stop,step]
I gave nothing to start and stop.So, it takes 0 as default. step -1 denotes starting from end and stop at the start. It becomes reverse string.
